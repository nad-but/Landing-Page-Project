## Instructions

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

A static version of the landing page project was displayed in the beginning project with the help of basic HTML and CSS style. Through the modifications I made, this project became interactive instead of static. To make the project interactive, that was accomplished by creating a full JavaScript file and making some changes to the HTML and CSS styling.
